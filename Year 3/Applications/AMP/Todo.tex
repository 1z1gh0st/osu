\title{Applying for AMP To Do List}
\author{Philip Warton}
\date{\today}
\maketitle
Looking to apply for the accelerated master's platform this January, or alternatively before May.
If possible, I would like to focus my studies on a mix between Topological structure, algebra, and computational methods.
Obviously this is quite ambitious, but the good news is that I have plenty of time to complete my undergrad (Spring 2022).
I spoke to Juha about enrolling in 531 this winter, and he told me that I would need an override from Adel, and that he would
be willing to put in a good word. Elaine Cozzi said that she would be willing to write a reccommendation, as did Tevian Dray.
For a third letter, I do not know who would be ideal to talk to... possibly Thomann, Adel, or Juha.

Course plan:
My main desires as far as courses are: 531, 532 this year, and 543 and possibly 634/5/6 next year. That being said, it is important that I
do not overspecialize, and take a breadth of courses to have a well rounded mathematical knowledge. I am hoping that it is possible to do both.

Other plans: I would like to perform research in my desired areas of focus. Finding something I can work on during this school year would be
ideal. But if do not find such an opportunity, then I would at least like to apply for some REU's for the summer of 2021.
