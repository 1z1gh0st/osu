\section*{Problem 1}
Prove that if $A$ is a compact subspace of a Hausdorff space $X$, 
then $A$ is closed in $X$: $A \subset^{cl} X$.
\\ \hline
\subsection*{Solution}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $x \in X \setminus A$.          
    Then for any point $a$ in $A$, we have some neighborhood of $a$, $U_a$,
    that is disjoint from some neighborhood of $x$, $V_a$, since $X$ is
    Hausdorff.
    Then it follows that 
    \[
    \bigcup_{a\in A}U_a
    \] 
    is an open cover cover of $A$. Since $A$ is compact, it follows that there is some finite subcover of $A$. We will denote this by
    \[
    \bigcup_{f\in F}U_f.
    \] 
    So then since $F$ is finite, it follows that the intersection
    \[
    \bigcap_{f\in F}V_f
    \] 
    is an open neighborhood of $x$ that is disjoint from our finite cover
    of $A$, and is therefore disjoint from $A$.
    So if any arbitrary point $x \notin  A$ has a neighborhood that is 
    disjoint from $A$, then $A$ is closed.
    \end{proof}

\section*{Problem 2}
Prove that if $\phi: B^n \ra X$ is a characteristic map for an $n$-cell $c^n $ in a Hausdorff space $X$, then $\bar{c}^n = \phi(B^n)$ is the closure of the open cell $c^n = \phi(\mathrm{int}(B^n))$ in $X$.
\\ \hline
\subsection*{Solution}
    \begin{proof}
    By \fbox{Problem 1}, we know that $\phi(B^n)$ is closed. This is
    because a continuous map carries compactness, and a compact subset of 
    a Hausdorff space is closed. By basic properties of sets and maps, we 
    know too that $\phi(int(B^n))\subset \phi(B^n)$.
    Suppose that $\phi(B^n)$ is not the closure of $\phi(int(B^n))$, then 
    it must be the case that $cl(\phi(int(B^n)))\subsetneq \phi(B^n)$.
    Then there must be some point $x \in \phi(B^n) \setminus cl(\phi(int(B^n)))$.
    Since $x$ is not a limit point of $\phi(int(B^n))$, we know that 
    $\phi^{-1}(x)$ is not a limit point of $int(B^n)$. This is a 
    contradiction because any point in $B^n$ is a limit point of $int(B^n)$.
    So we conclude that $\phi(B^n) = cl(c^n)$.
    \end{proof}
    What is left to show is that continuity preserves limit/accumulation points\ldots

\section*{Problem 3}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of closed subsets of a topological space $X$.
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item Prove that $\{A \subseteq X\ :\ A \cap F \subset^{cl} F\ \mbox{for all}\ F \in \mathcal{F}\}$ is the set of closed sets for a topology on $X$. This is called the \textbf{weak topology} on $X$ relative to $\mathcal{F}$. We write $X_w$ to refer to the set $X$ together with this weak topology.
\item Prove that if $U \subseteq X$, then $U \op X_w$ if and only if $U \cap F \subset^{op} F$ for all $F \in \mathcal{F}$.
\item Prove that for each $F \in \mathcal{F}$, the subspace topology inherited from $X_w$ is the same as the subspace topology inherited from $X$.
\item Prove that if $Y$ is any space, then a function $f:X_w \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if $f|_F: F \rightarrow Y$ is continuous for all $F \in \mathcal{F}$.
\item Prove that the identity function $1_X: X_w \rightarrow X$ is continuous.
\item Give an example to show that $X_w$ need not be homeomorphic to $X$.
\end{enumerate}
\\ \hline
    \subsection*{Solution}
    We denote $\{A \subset X \ : \ A \cap F \subset^{cl} F \text{for all} F \in \mathcal{F}\} = \mathcal{A}$.
    \subsubsection*{i.} 
    \begin{proof}
    We wish to show that if we let $\mathcal{A}$ be our family of closed sets, that this will form a topology on $X$. To do this, one must show that the axioms of a topological space hold.\\\\
    \fbox{$\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{A}$} We begin with the empty set.
    For any $F \in \mathcal{F}$
    \begin{align*}
        \emptyset \cap F = \emptyset \subset^{cl} F.
    \end{align*}
    For the universal set,
    \[
    X \cap F = F \subset^{cl} F.
    \] 
    \fbox{Closure under arbitrary intersection}
    Let 
    \[
    \bigcap_{i \in I}A_i
    \] 
    be some arbitrary intersection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$.
    Then let $F \in \mathcal{F}$ be arbitrary. It follows that 
    \[
    \left(\bigcap_{i \in I}A_i\right) \cap F = \bigcap_{i\in I}\left(A_i \cap F\right)
    \] 
    Since each $A_i \cap F$ is closed in the subspace of $F$, it follows that this intersection will also be closed.\\\\
    \fbox{Closure under finite union}
    Let
    \[
    \bigcup_{j \in J}A_j 
    \] 
    Be a finite union of sets in $\mathcal{A}$. Then let $F \in \mathcal{F}$ be arbitrary, and we write 
    \[
    \left(\bigcup_{j \in J}A_j\right) \cap F =
    \bigcup_{j\in J}\left(A_j \cap F\right)
    \] 
    Then each $A_j \cap F$ is closed in $F$ so it follows that a finite union of sets closed in $F$ is closed in $F$, and therefore this union belongs in $\mathcal{A}$. Having shown these three properties, this set of closed sets forms a topology on $X$.
    \end{proof}
    \subsubsection*{ii.}
    \begin{proof}
    Suppose that $U \subset X$. Then we know that 
    \begin{align*}
    U \subset^{op} X_w &\Leftrightarrow (X \setminus U) \subset^{cl} X_w\\
    &\Leftrightarrow (X \setminus U) \in \mathcal{A}\\
&\Leftrightarrow (X \setminus U) \cap F \subset^{cl} F \ \ \ \ \forall F \in \mathcal{F}\\
&\Leftrightarrow U \cap F \subset^{op} F \ \ \ \ \forall F\in\mathcal{F}\\
    \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
    \subsubsection*{iii.}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $F \in \mathcal{F}$ be arbitrary, without loss of generality.
    To show that the topologies are the same we will demonstrate that a set is closed in one topology if and only if it is closed in the other. Let $C \subset F$ be closed under the subspace topology induced by $X_w$.
    The set $C$ is closed in $F_w$ (slight abuse of notation, $F_w$ is $F$ equipped with the subspace topology induced by $X_w$) if and only if there exists some $C'$ closed in $X_w$ such that $C' \cap F = C$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        C' \subset^{cl} X_w &\Leftrightarrow C' \cap F \subset^{cl} F \ \ \ \ \forall F \in \mathcal{F} \\
    &\Leftrightarrow C' \cap F \subset^{cl} F \text{ for our fixed $F$} \\
    &\Leftrightarrow C \subset^{cl} F
    \end{align*}
    So we conclude that $C \subset^{cl} F_w$ if and only if $C \subset^{cl} F$.
    \end{proof}
    \subsubsection*{iv.}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $Y$ be any space. Then a function $f:X_w \rightarrow Y$ is 
    continuous if and only if closed sets in $Y$ have closed pre-images.
    Closed sets $C \subset Y$ have closed pre-images in $X_w$ if and only if $f^{-1}(C) \cap F \subset^{cl} F$ for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$.
    Then $f^{-1}(C) \cap F \subset^{cl} F$ for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$ if and only if $f^{-1}\big|_F(C) \subset^{cl} F$ for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$. And this is the case if and only if $f\big|_F$ is continuous for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$.
    \end{proof}
    \subsubsection*{v.}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $C \subset^{cl} X$. Then we wish to show that its pre-image under 
    the identity function is also closed. Let $F \in \mathcal{F}$ be 
    arbitrary without loss of generality. Then by definition of subspace 
    topology $C \cap F \subset^{cl} F$.
    Then it follows that if $C \cap F \subset^{cl} F$ for every $F$,
    then $C \subset^{cl} X_w$.
    \end{proof}
    \subsubsection*{vi.}
    Take $X = \mathbb{R}$. The let $\mathcal{F} = \{\{0\}\}$.
    Then what we are left with is the discrete, weakest, topology.
    That is, every set is both open and closed. If a set does not contain 0
    , then its intersection with every $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is empty and 
    is trivially closed. And if a set contains 0 then its intersection with
    every $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is $\{0\}$ and therefore closed in $\{0\}$.
    So $\mathbb{R}_w$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are not homeomorphic because 
    $\mathbb{R}$ is connected and $\mathbb{R}_w$ is disconnected. A simple 
    disconnection for $\mathbb{R}_w$ is $\mathbb{R}_w = \{0\} \cup 
    (\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\})$.
    Thus, we conclude that $X$ and $X_w$ need not be homeomorphic.

\section*{Problem 4}
Prove that if $(X,\mathcal{C})$ is a CW complex, then the zero-skeleton $X^0$ is discrete.
\\ \hline
    \subsection*{Solution}
    \begin{proof}
    Suppose that $(X,\mathcal{C})$ is a CW complex.
    The 0-skeleton $X^0$ is defined as
    \[
    (X^0, \mathcal{C}^0) \text{ where } \mathcal{C}^0 = \{c \in \mathcal{C} \ : \ dim(c) \leq 0\}, X^0 = \bigcup_{dim(c) \leq 0}c
    \] 
    Since our dimension is 0, this means that all our open cells $c \in \mathcal{C}$
    are of dimension 0 or lower. Since all cells of dimension $n < 0$ 
    are non-existent (being images of the empty set). We conclude that
    all open cells $c \in \mathcal{C}$ are of dimension 0.
    \[
    \forall c \in \mathcal{C}^0, dim(c) = 0
    \] 
    Let $c \in \mathcal{C}^0$ be arbitrary.
    Then by definition of a CW complex, $\{c\}$ is open.
    By definition of a 0-cell, $c$ is simply a single point in $X$.
    Then, since $X$ is Hausdorff, it follows $\{c\}$ is closed.
    Since the singleton set of any point in the 0-skeleton is both open and closed,
    it follows that $X^0$ is discrete.
    % Option 1 -- we violate colusre-finiteness (unlikely)
    % Option 2 -- we violate coherence (likely)
    % Option 3 -- we violate definition of CW-complex (also pretty likely)

    % As it turns out, option 3 was our friend. All cells are open + all singleton sets are closed
    % -> boom we are done
    \end{proof}

\section*{Problem 5}
Prove that $H_k(B^n,S^{n-1}) \cong \left\{\begin{array}{rl} \Z&k=n\\0&k\neq n\end{array}\right.$.
\section*{Problem 6}
Prove that if $$C: C_m \stackrel{\partial_m}{\ra} C_{m-1} \ra \cdots \ra C_1 \stackrel{\partial_1}{\ra} C_0$$ is a chain complex consisting of finitely generated abelian groups $C_0, \ldots, C_m$, then
$$
\sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i\mathrm{rk}(C_i) = \sum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i\mathrm{rk}(H_i(C)).
$$
Use this to prove that if $(X, \mathcal{C})$ is a finite CW complex and $\alpha_i$ is the number of $i$-cells in $\mathcal{C}$, then $$\chi(X,\mathcal{C}) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\mathrm{dim}(X)} (-1)^i \alpha_i$$ is an invariant of the homotopy type of the space $X$. In particular, this number is independent of the choice of (finite) cellular decomposition $\mathcal{C}$, so we denote this number by $\chi(X)$. It is the \textbf{Euler characteristic} of $X$.
\section*{Problem 7}
Calculate $\chi(X)$ where
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is a finite contractible CW complex
\item $X = S^n$
\end{enumerate}
