\title{Statment of Purpose}
\author{Philip Warton}
\maketitle
It was in my second year of Oregon State University that it came to my realization that I would not
be satisfied having studied only undergraduate mathematics. This correlates directly with the point in 
time where I became much more involved with the school's Mathematics Club, took courses in analysis and 
abstract algebra, and began regularly attending various math colloquia held at our University. I have 
continued this passion by helping to build community as the club's vice president and taking whichever 
mathematics courses most excited my during my time here. Now I find myself more interested and passionate about pursuing this than ever before. \\\\

robotics club - science team - meteorology, gis mapping, and data handling\\
comap mathematical modeling competition - successful solution - geometric problem solving in an applied/computational setting\\
statistics course - statistical analysis of graduate school applications\\
non-euclidean geometry - derived 13-point projective plane \\
lucid programming competition - participated\\
computational toplogy reading group - 2021\\
tda seminars - 2021\\
graduate courses 2020-2021
Now we actaully have to write this shit up today or we are completely fucked for good.
