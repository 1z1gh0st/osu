1 - PHILIP WARTON

Question 1:
    There was an error compiling saying that ';' was expected before return.
    We need to indicate the end of a statement using the semicolon.

Quesiton 2:
	Cout and endl are not recognized as members of the std library because we did not include iostream (input and output)

Question 3:
	Nothing happens. In c++ whitespace is ignored unless it is within a string.

Question 4:
	Since the new line is within the whitespace, there is a warning when compiling, but the program still runs.

Question 5:
	There is no new line being printed so the shell prompt is displayed on the same line as the Hello, world!

Question 6:
	Error compiling saying no type named std::cout, its looking for a datatype but instead sees a function.

Quesiton 7:
	error: invalid operands to binary expression
	The input gets stored to the variable:
		input -> variable
	The other way around would not make sense.

Question 8:
	You have to allocate a place in memory to store the data. Otherwise the computer doesn't know where to put it.
